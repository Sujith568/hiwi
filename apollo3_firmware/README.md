This repository contains the firmware project to be used and edited to work with the Apollo3 sensor node platform.

Currently all written Libraries are included in the project and are tested to work on the Apollo 3 sensor test platform. 

In the default state, the PAR and the Temperature/Humidity are measured every 100 ms

Instuctions to setup the IDE:
* Make an account at ARM/KEIL and follow the instructions here: https://www.keil.arm.com/mdk-community/
* Download the Ambiq Suite SDK and unpack it somewhere on your computer (https://contentportal.ambiq.com/)
* Use the package installer from uVision and download the Ambiq device support package (maybe the use of Version 1.3.0 is required: 1.4.1 may cause some problems)
* Download the Apollo 3 library from Gitea
* Download the Apollo 3 Firmware from Gitea
* Open the ApolloFirmware and rightclick on the lefthand side target 1 and select options for target. Click on C/C++ and add the defines : AM_PACKAGE_BGA AM_PART_APOLLO3
* In the same window: open the include paths and adjust the location for the library and Ambiq Suite 
* Click on Debug: select J-Link for he used probe, click on settings and choose PORT: SW
* The files in the folder lib & utils may need to be re-added: delete all of the them and add them again with your Ambiq Suite location (AmbiqSuite_R3.0.0\mcu\apollo3\hal\) & (AmbiqSuite_R3.0.0\utils)
* Once this is done compilation should be possible. If not, check the following things:
* a.	Browse to the am_hal_debug.h file and search for DBG_FILENAME and replace __MODULE__ with __FILE_NAME__ in line 92. For further reference look https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100068/0618/Migrating-from-armcc-to-armclang/Migrating-predefined-macros
* If the core_cm4.h indicates errors, the is probably a problem with the Ambiq device support package: quick fix could be copying the RTE folder of project from the Gitea
